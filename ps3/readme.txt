3. Problem Statement: Rounding an integer to the next largest multiple.

You are tasked with creating a Program that takes two positive integers, I and J as input and rounds I up to the next largest multiple of J. The Program should ensure that the result is the smallest integer K such that k is divisible by J

Input: The Program should accept two integers, I and J, where I<=J, J<=10^6

Output:The Program Should display the rounded-up integer k.

test_case1:

input:256
      7
output:259

test_case2:

input:120
      10
