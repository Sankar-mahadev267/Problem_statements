1. Problem Statement: Days to years, Months, and Days Conversion.

You are tasked with developing a Program that takes a positive, integer refresenting a number of days as input and Converts it into years, months, and remaining days. The goal is to Provide a user-friendly representation of a given duration in terms of the number of full years ,full months and any remaining days

Input: 
The Program should accept a positive integer, n, where 1<=n<=1017.

Output: 
The Program should display the equivalent duration in years months, and days.

Conversion rules:

• Assume that each year has 365 days, each month has so days for simplicity

• when Converting days to months, Consider a month having 30days

• A year is considered to have 12 months

• If the remaining days are less than 30,they should be displayed as x days.
